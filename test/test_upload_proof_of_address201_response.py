    # Introduction Description of Bankable Credit RESTful API. Current limitations: - The Credit service does not support [cross origin headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS) for security reasons. It is not possible to use Swagger UI and make API calls directly from the browser. - Modification API requests (`POST`, `DELETE`) require additional security scopes granted under the service agreement. - Consider the Bankable limitations for API calls that depend on the contract agreement.
